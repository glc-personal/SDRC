# SDRC
Self-Driving RC project.

# Current State:
Purely an idea, I would like to build an RC from scratch, use some kind of radar for relative positioning, and a camera for image segmentation.

# Shopping List:
- Arduino Uno ($27)
- Servos (4)
- 

# Goals:
- build an RC
- build traffic lights with LEDs
- use action figures to simulate pedestrians
- use radar for relative positioning
- train the RC to drive around my apartment
- use image segmentation to learn traffic lights and to avoid pedestrians.

# Note(s):
This is a long term project which will take a significant amount of testing.

# Modules:
- teensy?

# Classes:
