# SDRC
Self-Driving RC project.

# Current State:
Purely an idea, I would like to build an RC from scratch, use some kind of radar for relative positioning, and a camera for image segmentation.

# Shopping List:
- Arduino Uno ($27)
  - for controlling the RC car programmatically to then load a model on it for image segmentation to see pedestrians, traffic lights, stop signs, etc.
  - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008GRTSV6/ref=ox_sc_act_image_4?smid=AA57DDZKZUZDL&psc=1
- Servos (4)
  - motors for the wheels.
  - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MLR1498/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A2QTZX14X1D97I&th=1
- Camera
  - for seeing what is in front of the RC car to use a model for image segmentation.

- USB Data Transfer Cable
  - needed for arduino controller
  - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08RCJXY1Z/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
- Motor Driver Controller Board
  - for controlling the motors
- Ultrasonic Module Distance Sensor
  - for distance sensing
- Microwave Doppler Radar Motion Detector Sensor
  - for motion detection
- LiDAR Range Finder Senor Module (0.2 - 8 m)
  - for depth sensing 

# Goals:
- build an RC
- build traffic lights with LEDs
- use action figures to simulate pedestrians
- use radar for relative positioning
- train the RC to drive around my apartment
- use image segmentation to learn traffic lights and to avoid pedestrians.

# Note(s):
- This is a long term project which will take a significant amount of testing.
- Use Redmine for project management.

# Modules:
- teensy?

# Classes:
